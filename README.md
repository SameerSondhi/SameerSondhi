👋 Hi, I’m Sameer!

I am a Full-Stack Developer specializing in AI-powered web applications, API integrations, and scalable CMS solutions. My expertise spans WordPress (custom themes, plugins, API extensions), modern frontend frameworks (React.js, Next.js), and backend technologies (FastAPI, Node.js, Python, TypeScript). Whether it’s extending WordPress beyond a traditional CMS or developing AI-driven SaaS applications, I build solutions that optimize performance, scalability, and user experience.

🔹 Why Both WordPress & AI-Powered Development?
My journey into web development started with a passion for building structured, intuitive digital experiences. Over time, I expanded my skill set to include AI integrations, cloud-based APIs, and full-stack SaaS development, enabling me to work on both CMS-powered platforms and AI-driven applications.

💻 Technical Expertise:
✔️ AI-Powered APIs & SaaS Development – FastAPI, OpenAI API, AI automation.
✔️ Custom WordPress Solutions – Advanced themes, plugins, CPTs, hooks, filters.
✔️ API Integrations – RESTful & GraphQL APIs, third-party services, authentication.
✔️ Performance Optimization – Caching, speed enhancements, SEO, accessibility (WCAG/ADA).
✔️ Modern Frontend Engineering – React.js, Next.js, Redux, WordPress headless architecture.
✔️ Cloud & DevOps – AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda), Docker, GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
