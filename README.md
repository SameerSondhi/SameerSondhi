👋 Hi, I’m Sameer!

🚀 I'm a product-minded SaaS builder and full stack developer focused on shipping AI-powered platforms that solve real-world GTM and growth challenges. I blend software engineering with product strategy to launch tools that drive user acquisition, automate workflows, and deliver measurable business value.

💡 Currently building StackPilot — an AI GTM orchestration platform with real-time lead enrichment, AI-powered messaging, activity tracking, and role-based dashboards. Built with React, Supabase, Node.js, and integrated with Clearbit and Together AI.

🔧 What I bring to the table:
• Product Development & Ownership – Roadmapping, MVP design, user feedback loops, and agile iteration
• Full Stack Engineering – React, Node.js, Supabase/Firebase, REST APIs, serverless architecture
• AI & GTM Systems – Together AI (Mixtral), Clearbit, CRM workflows, lead scoring, webhook automation
• Builder Mentality – Rapid prototyping, zero-to-one execution, customer-focused problem solving

I’m passionate about building SaaS products that bridge technical execution and business growth, and I’m open to opportunities across:
• Associate Product Management
• Full Stack Product Engineering
• GTM Engineering & AI SaaS Development

📬 Let’s connect if you’re building the future of software, AI, or GTM tech!
