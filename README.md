👋 Hi, I’m Sameer!

I’m a full-stack developer passionate about building responsive, scalable, and user-friendly applications — from polished frontends to robust backend services. My core stack includes React, Next.js, FastAPI, and Golang, with experience designing APIs, integrating third-party services, and deploying cloud-ready solutions.

I’ve delivered projects for startups, small businesses, and founders, including AI-powered productivity platforms, multi-tenant SaaS tools, and compliance-conscious applications. I enjoy translating complex workflows into intuitive, efficient experiences — whether for internal teams or customer-facing platforms.

Recently, I’ve been exploring Golang for high-performance backend services, integrating LLMs into practical tools, and building cross-platform mobile apps with React Native. My focus is on shipping scalable software that’s maintainable, secure, and genuinely useful.
