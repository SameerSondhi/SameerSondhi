👋 Hi, I’m Sameer!

I’m a full-stack developer with a strong foundation in building responsive, intuitive web applications — from dynamic dashboards to internal tools and customer-facing platforms. I enjoy turning complex workflows into seamless, user-friendly experiences using tools like React, Next.js, Tailwind, and Node.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked across the stack to support small businesses, startups, and solo founders — delivering everything from content-driven sites to AI-enhanced platforms that automate and enrich user workflows. My recent interests include building GTM platforms, integrating AI models into practical tools, exploring mobile development with React Native & Flutter, and building for the cloud with Supabase and serverless backends.

Whether it’s shipping polished frontends, building robust APIs, or exploring new ways to simplify user experiences with AI, I’m always focused on creating meaningful, usable software that scales with real needs.
